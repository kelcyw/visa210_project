# "Sh*t People Say"
This is a final project created for VISA 210 (Digital Arts) using three.js, JavaScript, and various 3D object models and textures. 

My idea for my final project was inspired by “Writing The Implosion: Teaching the World One Thing at a Time,” bathroom stall graffiti, and anonymous/semi-anonymous forums and discussion boards. I was initially intrigued by the similarities I perceived between the bathroom stall graffiti and online discussion boards; both places with a relatively high degree of anonymity, where anyone could write anything they wanted to. I became particularly interested in exploring what people tend to say in these environments, especially when they are able to remove what they are saying from their physical self or body (like when you make an online post using a username, or write something on a whiteboard - it is impossible, or at least very difficult to trace what you posted or wrote back to you.) I realized that the bathroom stall could be seen as a sort of “low-tech” form of a discussion forum; an anonymous space where anyone could write anything, and have it be seen by anyone. 

The initial inspiration for the medium of the project came from some feedback by a TA from another art course; I had introduced the project as a collection of photographs, but the TA thought that it may be more interesting to create a model bathroom stall and to bring the space to the viewer, as opposed to the other way around. I felt that I didn’t have the experience and resources to create a physical bathroom stall, but I realized I could utilize skills from other coursework to create a digital one instead. I realized I had effectively blended the physical bathroom stall with the online forums and discussion sites by making the project as a 3D environment in a web-browser. By merging the physical space with the web-based space, I hope to blur the lines between them, and to highlight the nature of these anonymous comments. 

While reflecting on the process of building and coding the 3D environment, I am reminded of the creation of the Internet itself; I was effectively building a bathroom stall, which has a predetermined function, but has provided unintentional features separated from its original purpose. I am reminded of how the Internet initially came about, for military and government communication, but has since grown to become much more. One example that I find particularly interesting is the “self-organizing network” discussed in “All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace: The Use and Abuse of Vegetational Concepts,” where the Internet has become a tool for revolution and for the creation of new “societies.” I see a similar nature coming out with the bathroom stall graffiti; a lot of comments are related to current world events, and a lot of commenters feel that the anonymous nature of the space allows them to express things that they wouldn’t typically say out loud. Of course, this can allow people to express both positive and negative things; I personally wish I had explored the latter a bit more, and challenged myself to put some more controversial material into my final project.
